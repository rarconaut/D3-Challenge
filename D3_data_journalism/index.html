          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>This is a basic scatter plot made using D3 SVG elements for the fictition D3Times publication. It uses a
            sample dataset of health and demographic from US States to demonstrate some of the capabilities of using D3
            for data visualization. While data analysis is not the primary goal of this project (i.e. D3 & JavaScript
            web visualization), in general we can see a negative correlation between obesity and income in this dataset.
            Based on this sample dataset, Colorado appears to be the healthiest state to reside in while Mississippi
            appears to be the unhealthiest, both with regard to obesity.
          </p>

          <p>Some unique features include:
          <ul>
            <li>The chart pulls data from a CSV file using the d3.csv method.</li>
            <li>D3 SVG elements create & situate its axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.</li>
            <li>Each data point is labeled with its state abbreviation.</li>
            <li>A dynamic d3-tip.js plugin tooltip I modified to expand each data point to display additional
              information.</li>
            <li>Event handlers for user mouse clicks & mounsing out to change data point size and color.</li>
            <li>After the user has finished inspecting a particular data point, its color is changed again to a third
              color to show which points have already been viewed (Otherwise, with 50 data points the user would have a
              hard time remembering which ones they have and haven't seen).</li>
          </ul>
